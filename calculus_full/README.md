## Note the production files are in metric units

If you need to switch it to some other system, you'll need to open the KiCAD files and generate your own production files (it's very easy)

Also note these boards have a little note in silkscreen on the back with my name and where they were designed. It's meant to be a kind note that I cared to design these for you, and I hope you enjoy them.

You may remove it if you wish. Just open up the PCB in KiCAD, select the text, and press delete. Then re-export the production files.

## KiCAD files

There are some custom footprints I think? Not sure how that gets handled. Let me know if anything outright breaks.
