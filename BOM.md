All parts surface-mount unless otherwise noted. Let me know if I've missed something. Black PCBs look pretty cool with this design.


## for 3 Main segments
3x TM1640 LED drive control IC
18x two-digit LED display, common ground (I used 2821AS, these are through-hole parts)
27x 5050 RGB LED
3x 1.25mm ZH female connector (these are through-hole parts)
3x 1411 Tantalum capacitor 100uf 6.3V
3x 0603 0.1uF ceramic capacitor 50V
6x 0402 10k ohm resistor
3x PBC subunit

## For center tile
1x TM1640 LED drive control IC
3x 0402 10k ohm resistor
1x 1411 Tantalum capacitor 100uf 6.3V
1x 0603 0.1uF ceramic capacitor 50V
1x 5050 RGB LED
1x generic pushbutton. Check the board for dimensions, it's one of the super common types (this is a through-hole part)
1x two-digit LED display, common ground (I used 2821AS, these are through-hole parts)
1x XIAO RP2040 module (we're using it as a surface mount part!)
3x 1.25mm ZH female connector (these are through-hole parts)


## General
3x 1.25mm male-male connector (cable). Mind the pinout, some cables reverse pin order.
1x USB external battery for phone (to power the game)
1x male USB cable (for power). Probably you want one end USB, then solder the power lines directly to the center tile. I've left yo usome pads for this, but anywhere 5V/GND goes is fine.
15x 3mm wide bolt+nut (length depends on the rubber feet you choose)
15x rubber foot. Minimum length 8mm. Recommend 10mm. You can also bolt the boards to a surface instead of using feet.
