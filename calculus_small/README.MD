# Pieces
For this game size, brass hex spacers, bolts, and nuts work really well.

- Hex spacers are 'tunnels'
- Nuts are 'mines'
- Nuts with a bolt slightly screwed in are 'drills'

If you color them with permanent marker, they look quite nice.

# Routing
Yeah, the routing on this board is very YOLO. Feel free to make improvements. I have only a few hours of free time per week so optimized for getting the thing done.

# Notes
The production files are in metric units.
